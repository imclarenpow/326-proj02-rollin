 This algorithm may not be optimal yet, will also need to compare to PowisTestImplementation to see which works better. I have checked over and coded everything up to the "There **is** one set" branch, but have not yet checked and coded the "There **isn't** one set" branch. Everything I have looked over so far seems to be as optimal as I can think of.

 ## Algorithm:
 
 - Check for a complete game
    - If there is, return -1;
    - If there isn't, continue;
 - Check if the roll will complete the game
    - If it does, return the index that will complete it;
    - If it doesn't, continue;
 - Check if there is already one set
    - There **is** one set **(Has been checked, but may still be incomplete)**:
        - Check if the remaining dice have a pair
            - If there is a pair, check if abs(roll - pairValue) < abs(nonPairValue - pairValue)
                - If true, replace nonPairValue with roll
                - If false, return -1;
            - If there is not a pair try to create a pair with the roll
                - Check if you can create a pair
                    - If yes, check if either of the other 2 numbers is +- 1 from the roll
                        - If yes, swap the roll for the remaining 3rd number
                        - If no, check if either of the other 2 numbers is +- 2 from the roll
                            - If yes, swap the roll for the remaining 3rd number
                            - If no, return -1;
                - If you can't create a pair, check if the roll is +- 1 from a dice
                    - If yes, replace a dice that is not +- 1 from the roll
                    - If it isn't, check if the roll is +- 2 from a dice
                        - If yes, replace any dice that is not +- 2 from the roll
                        - If no, return -1;        
    - There **isn't** one set **(NEEDS CHECKING)**:
        - Check if the roll will complete a set
            - If no, check for a pairs
                - If there are pairs then check if the roll is +- 1 or +- 2 from any pair, then add the roll anywhere other than the pair
                - If no pair, check if the roll will complete a pair
                    - If yes, check if any of the other 5 dice are +- 1 from the roll value
                        - If yes, don't replace the +- 1, replace any of the other 4 dice
                        - If no, check if any of the other 5 dice are +- 2 from the roll value
                            - If yes, don't replace the +- 2, replace any of the other 4 dice
                            - If no, replace any of the other 5 dice
                    - If no, return -1;
            - If yes, check for a pair
                - If there is a pair, check if there are multiple pairs
                    - If there are multiple pairs, check each pair for a +- 1
                        - If any pair has a +- 1, group that pair with that +- 1 in a separate array
                            - Check the rest of the pairs for a +- 2 (if there are any pairs left) and group them with their +- 2 if they exist
                        - If there aren't, check the single pair for a +- 1 and group those 3 together separately
                            - If no +- 1, check for a +- 2 and group
                                - If no +- 2 then place the roll in the remaining 4 dice to complete the set if possible
                                    - If not, replace one of the pair dice
                                - If there is a +- 2 then check if the roll can be placed anywhere in the remaining 3 dice to complete a set
                                    - If not, replace the +- 2 dice if possible
                                        - If not, replace one of the pair dice
                            - If there is +- 1 then check if the roll can be placed anywhere in the remaining 3 dice to complete a set
                                - If not, replace the +- 1 dice if possible
                                    - If not, replace one of the pair dice 
                - If there is one pair: check for a +- 1 from the pair
                    - If there is, check the remaining 3 to see if the roll can complete a set from them
                        - If not, replace the +- 1 to form a set if possible
                            - If not, replace one of the pair dice to complete the set
                    - If there isn't, check for a +- 2
                        - If there is, check the remaining 3 to see if the roll can complete a set from them
                            - If not, replace the +- 2 to form a set if possible
                                - If not, replace one of the pair dice to complete the set
                        - If there isn't, check the remaining 4 to see if the roll can complete a set from them
                            - If yes, complete the set
                            - If no, replace one of the pair dice to complete the set
